## Reason

The reason for this assignment this week was to continue to learn express.js logic and be introduced to deploying an app to Heroku using MongoDB. The assignment also required us to use Mogoose schema. We were given the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria:

```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

```
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
```

## Take-Aways

Plan your coding and do little bits at a time, commit often as well. When you get stuck or blocked take a break and come back at it fresh (worked for me).
